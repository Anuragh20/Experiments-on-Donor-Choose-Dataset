To get a better understanding of various Machine Learning Algorithms.

Contents:
1.	FILE 1: Performance of NB (CountVec vs TFIDF)
    
    a. Evaluation of the Performance of the Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm on the Donors Choose dataset on two sets of data with Set 1: Use of CountVectorizer to vectorize the columns   with Text data Vs Set 2: Use of TFIDF Vectorizer to vectorize the columns with Text data

2.	 FILE 2: Decision Trees Performance (TFIDF vs TFIDF W2V)
    
    a. Evaluation of the Performance of Decision Tree Classifier on the Donors Choose dataset on two sets of data with Set 1: Use of TFIDF Vectorizer to vectorize the columns with Text data Vs Set 2: Use of TFIDF W2V Vectorizer to vectorize the columns with Text data

3.	File 3: SMOTE, TSNE, Xgboost on Donor Choose Dataset
    
    a. Explored the Over sampling techniques such as SMOTE and SMOTomek and used TSNE in order to visualize the distribution of Data and evaluating the performance of the Xgboost algorithm
